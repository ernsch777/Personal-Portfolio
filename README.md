1. Time to write my own portfolio site. I think I am going to start from scratch and keep it basic vanilla code. 
2. Branched off the master branche to change my main background to a gradient I really like, but got carried away and built out most of the site, added animations, and all 4 sections without uploading for a few days. 
3. Added projects and about sections with spacing and links. Going to add a hover effect for the projects cards instead of putting the description of each on top of the images.
4. Added an awesome mouse over linear gradient effct to the project cards and formatted titles. Worked on responsiveness a bit as well.  Need to tackle formatting the about section tomorrow and will try to add more down arrows to site, and then I'm about ready to wrap it up for now. 
5. Finished responsiveness except for About section.  Entered text but need to do final formatting of the About section. 
6. Tweaked responsiveness again. Setup About section fully except that I am going to redo the images and image size, so will have to adjust alignment after that. Fixes some spelling errors. Re-ordered a little of the HTML. 
7. About section fully complete. Site needs testing on multiple sized screens and then it should be production ready.



Future improvements and features list: 
1) add flashing down arrows to each section 
2) add title bar motion for each section 
3) add more of my work to the projects section
