1. Time to write my own portfolio site. I think I am going to start from scratch and keep it basic vanilla code. 
2. Branched off the main to change my main background to a gradient a really like, but got carried away and built out most of the site, added animations, and all 4 sections.
3. Added projects and about sections with spacing and links. Going to add a hover effect for the projects cards instead of putting the description of each on top of the images.
